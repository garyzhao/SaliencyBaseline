# Saliency Baseline

This MATLAB code is for the ACCV 2014 Paper "Size and Location Matter: a New Baseline for Salient Object Detection", and can only be used for non-comercial purpose. If you use our code, please cite our paper [1].

## How to Use

Run `demo.m` to learn how to use Saliency Baseline [1], as well as Saliency Optimization [2], Saliency Filter [3], Geodesic Saliency [4], and Manifold Ranking [5].
